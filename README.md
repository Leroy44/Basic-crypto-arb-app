### Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, pathlib
### Datasets: bitcoin closing price data from bitstamp and coinbase exchanges
### The objective of the cryptocurrency arbitrageur for the purpose of the this study is to maximize bitcoin arbitrage profit by buying cheap on one exchange and selling higher on the other.  Such opportunities are rare, so it is important to study a reasonably high frequency of intraday price observations  Two datasets have been collected: price and timestamp data from Bitstamp and Coinbase during the first quarter of 2018. Next, the data was prepared by cleaning out values that may undermine our analysis.  As a final step, we conduct our analysis of the data set.  This is a "collect --> prepare --> analyze" process for data analytics.
